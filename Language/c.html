            <p>
                Known for its low-level memory manipulation and strong hardware interaction capabilities, C is the foundation for many modern programming languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's widely used in systems programming, embedded programming, and software development. C's syntax and concepts form the basis for C++, C#, and many other languages.
